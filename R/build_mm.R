#' Build a Markov Model
#'
#' Function \code{build_mm} builds and automatically estimates a Markov model. It is also a shortcut for 
#' constructing a Markov model as a restricted case of an \code{hmm} object.
#' @export
#' @param observations An \code{stslist} object (see \code{\link[TraMineR]{seqdef}}) containing
#' the sequences.
#' @return Object of class \code{hmm} with following elements:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{\code{observations}}{State sequence object or a list of such containing the data.}
#'    \item{\code{transition_probs}}{A matrix of transition probabilities.}
#'    \item{\code{emission_probs}}{A matrix or a list of matrices of emission probabilities.}
#'    \item{\code{initial_probs}}{A vector of initial probabilities.}
#'    \item{\code{state_names}}{Names for hidden states.}
#'    \item{\code{symbol_names}}{Names for observed states.}
#'    \item{\code{channel_names}}{Names for channels of sequence data.}
#'    \item{\code{length_of_sequences}}{(Maximum) length of sequences.}
#'    \item{\code{n_sequences}}{Number of sequences.}
#'    \item{\code{n_symbols}}{Number of observed states (in each channel).}
#'    \item{\code{n_states}}{Number of hidden states.}
#'    \item{\code{n_channels}}{Number of channels.}
#'}
#'
#' @details Unlike the other build functions in \code{seqHMM}, the \code{build_mm} function
#' automatically estimates the model parameters. In case of no missing values, 
#' initial and transition probabilities are
#' directly estimated from the observed initial state probabilities and transition counts.
#' In case of missing values, the EM algorithm is run once.
#' 
#' Note that it is possible that the data contains a symbol from which there are 
#' no transitions anywhere (even to itself), which would lead to a row in 
#' transition matrix full of zeros. In this case the `build_mm` 
#' (as well as the EM algorithm) assumes that the 
#' the state is absorbing in a way that probability of staying in this state is 1.
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{plot.hmm}} for plotting the model.
